            <h2>School Boundaries</h2>

            <p>Every address in DC is assigned, or zoned, to a school boundary. Students living within that boundary have the right to attend a specific school or schools. These boundaries have not been comprehensively reviewed since the 1970s, even as schools have opened or closed and the city's population has changed.</p>

            <% if (boundaryChanged) { if (oldES === 'CLOSED') { %>

                <p>The school you are currently zoned for, <%= oldBoundary.feature.properties.SCHOOLNAME %> ES, has been closed, and we are missing information about the school to which your address is currently assigned. You can look up the schools zoned for your address using DCPS's <a href="http://dcatlas.dcgis.dc.gov/schools/" target="_blank">EBIS</a> tool. The proposed school boundaries would zone you for <%= helpers.learndcLink(newES) %>.</p>

                <% } else { %>

                <p>Under the new boundary proposal, your address would be assigned to a different school boundary, which would be <%= newBoundary.feature.properties.CHANGE %> This means that you would be zoned for <%= helpers.learndcLink(newES) %> instead of <%= helpers.learndcLink(oldES) %>.</p>

            <h2>Feeder Patterns</h2>

            <p>Every traditional elementary school "feeds" its students to a middle and a high school. These chains of schools are known as "feeder patterns." In some cases, these patterns are currently inconsistent or result in overcrowded schools.</p>

            <% if (oldES.old_fp_ms === newES.new_fp_ms && oldES.old_fp_hs === newES.new_fp_hs) { %>

            <p>Similar to <a href="#es-choice-sets">elementary school choice sets</a>, the Advisory Committee is considering choice sets for middle schools. Students would be guaranteed access to one of the schools in the choice set but not to a specific school.</p>

            <p>Middle school choice sets would likely be paired with a plan to give every middle school a special focus, such as two-language instruction or an emphasis on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) programs. Which schools would focus on which topics has not been proposed yet.</p>
